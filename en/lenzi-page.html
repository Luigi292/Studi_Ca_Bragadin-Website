      <h3>Corporate Contracting</h3>
      <p>Lenzi Practice offers a complete consultancy service for businesses for the drafting of commercial contracts, both under Italian law and international law, and the stipulation and review of all corporate contracting.</p>
      <p>The professionals at the Practice have developed great competence and experience in drafting corporate contracts such as, for example, trademark purchase contracts, agency contracts, supply contracts, distribution contracts, lease and transfer of business branch contracts.</p>
      <p>The growing complexity in relationships between businesses and between businesses and private individuals makes it increasingly necessary to regulate business relationships in advance, in order to protect the company in case the contractual relationship with third parties evolves negatively.</p>
      <p>A careful analysis and evaluation of the company's interests, followed by prudent negotiation, allows first of all to obtain for the client the most advantageous contractual conditions possible and, then, to avoid the risk of judicial disputes that can last for years with the consequent economic damage.</p>

      <h3>Civil Litigation, Arbitration, Mediation</h3>
      <p>By virtue of the professional experience gained, Lenzi Practice is able to resolve the legal issues of its clients in a rapid and effective manner, evaluating together with them the expenditure in terms of time and resources, based on the probability of success in judicial litigation.</p>
      <p>For this very reason, Lenzi Practice operates with the aim of avoiding as much as possible the establishment of a long and costly civil process, adopting alternative methods of dispute resolution, such as direct negotiation with the counterparty and conciliation.</p>
      <p>In case of failure of attempts at conciliation between the parties, the practice is able to assist businesses in the arbitration procedure (ex art. 806 cpc) which, thanks to the peculiarities of speed, efficiency and confidentiality inherent in the instrument, is preferable to judicial litigation, while having the validity of a judgment rendered by a Court.</p>
      <p>For cases provided for by Law no. 98/13 converting Decree-Law no. 69/13, the path of recourse to the institute of civil and commercial mediation is also viable: an instrument that offers the possibility of resolving civil disputes, without the intervention of the Court, in short times and with reduced costs.</p>
